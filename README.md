## My process

1.- Gathered the fonts and colors to be used in the entire project.
2.- Created a semantic HTML structure.
3.- Added basic styles such as fonts and font size to be used.
4.- Gave styles to the sections with pure css and flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scaled to desktop version

### What I learned

I applied the "margin: 0 auto:" to make it easier to center 
my sections once I've chosen to give them less than 100% width, 
asking the browser to help me center them automatically.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css: 

.main-payment-container{
    width: 85%;
    height: 80px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding-top: 15px;
    padding-left: 13px;
    padding-right: 13px;
}

```


### Continued development

I'm still not sure on how to use grid, since I've never really used it. 
Just know the theory. I need to keep studying about it and start implementing it.


### Useful resources

There were no resources in this challenge other than my head.
